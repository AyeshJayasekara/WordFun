# WordFun
QT based C++ simple word search game.
Initially developed for a university project.
This game is written in C++ by using QT framework. The game logic is pretty basic and simple. Two players takes turns interchangeably to generate random set of letters, out of which the player has to create the longest possible word. Then the turn is passed to the other player to do the same. Players can stop the game at any point and the player with highest score at that time will become the overall winner of the game round.
